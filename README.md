# AuthorBibCreator
Reads .bib files containing academic articles and creates .json files with bibliographies in NJ, IEEE, ACM styles

Please note that as of upload, the .bib files to be read must be located in the src folder.

If you decide to run the software again after the output folder has been populated with your bibliographies, it will relegate your original bibliographies to backup files in addition to the new files, resulting in a total of 6 files (3 of which will be labeled with BU).
