# AuthorBibCreator
Reads .bib files containing academic articles and creates .json files with bibliographies in NJ, IEEE, ACM styles

Please note that as of upload, the .bib files to be read must be located in the src folder.

If you decide to run the software again after the output folder has been populated with your bibliographies, it will relegate your original bibliographies to backup files in addition to the new files, resulting in a total of 6 files (3 of which will be labeled with BU).

For documentation, many comments have been included, including javadoc. Note that while the javadoc is included in the code, it is not generated. Be sure to generate javadoc on your own to see its full benefit.

What I learned (and techniques I used) i this project:
- File I/O
